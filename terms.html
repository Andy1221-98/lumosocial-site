        <p><strong>Last Updated: 【January 5, 2026】</strong></p>

        <p>This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“User” or “You”) and <strong>【Bit Joy】</strong> (“Licensor,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) governing your use of the <strong>Tact</strong> mobile application (the “App”).</p>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you (a) acknowledge that you have read and understand this Agreement; (b) represent that you are of legal age to enter into a binding agreement; and (c) accept this Agreement and agree that you are legally bound by its terms. If you do not agree to these terms, do not download, install, or use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes on a single Android device that you own or control.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of the App</h2>
        <p>Tact is a <strong>local task management application</strong>. Its core features include creating tasks with reminders, organizing them with labels and priorities, and reviewing historical records. The App is designed as an <strong>“offline-first”</strong> tool:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Internet Required</strong>: The core functionality does not require an active internet connection.</li>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts</strong>: The App does not operate a user account system or cloud synchronization service.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Data Storage</strong>: All data you create (tasks, settings) is stored exclusively on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The App, including its code, design, graphics, trademarks, and all content therein, is our exclusive intellectual property and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, modify, or create derivative works of the App.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
            <li>Remove any proprietary notices or labels.</li>
            <li>Use the App for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Responsibilities &amp; Content</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>

            <li>Maintaining the security of your device and preventing unauthorized access to your data within the App.</li>
            <li>Ensuring your device is charged and functional to receive scheduled reminders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You agree not to use the App to store or manage any illegal, harmful, or infringing content.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The current version of the Tact App <strong>does not integrate any third-party services</strong> (such as analytics, advertising, or cloud storage SDKs) that would require external data processing. Therefore, no user data is shared with third-party providers.</p>
        <p>The App is distributed via the Google Play Store, and your use of the store is governed by Google’s own <a href="https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Terms of Service</a>.</p>

        <p>We may update this Agreement from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Agreement within the App or on our website and updating the “Last Updated” date.

        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of <strong>【the laws of the People‘s Republic of China】</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts located in that jurisdiction.</p>
