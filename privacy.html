        <h1>Privacy Policy for Tact</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: 【January 5, 2026】</strong></p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>TL;DR (The Short Version)</strong></p>
            <p>Tact is an <strong>offline-first</strong> task manager. All your task data (titles, descriptions, dates) is stored <strong>only on your device</strong>. We do not have servers that collect your personal tasks. The app requests specific system permissions (like notification and alarm) <strong>solely to provide reliable reminders locally on your phone</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled in connection with the <strong>Tact</strong> mobile application (the “App”), provided by <strong>【你的公司/开发者名称，例如：Tact Studio】</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>To be perfectly clear, the Tact App is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Account or Cloud Sync</strong>: We do not operate user accounts or cloud synchronization servers. Your data stays with you.</li>
            <li><strong>No Tracking</strong>: We do not use analytics SDKs (like Google Analytics for Firebase), advertising SDKs (like AdMob), or any other tracking libraries that collect usage data.</li>
            <li><strong>No Sensitive Data</strong>: The App does not request or have access to your location, contacts, camera, microphone, or photo gallery.</li>
            <li><strong>No Financial Data</strong>: The App does not process any payments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information Processed Locally on Your Device</h2>
        <p>The App processes the following data exclusively on your device to provide its core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Entered Task Data</strong>: This includes the title, description, priority, labels, and due date/time you create for your tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences</strong>: Settings you choose within the App, such as your preferred reminder sound and vibration setting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Storage:</strong> All this information is stored locally on your device using the Android system's secure storage mechanisms (SharedPreferences and local files). It is <strong>never transmitted to us or any third party</strong>.</p>

        <h2>3. System Permissions and Why We Need Them</h2>
        <p>To deliver reliable task reminders, the App requests certain Android system permissions. These permissions are used <strong>strictly for local functionality on your device</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS)</strong>: To display reminder alerts.</li>
            <li><strong>Exact Alarm (SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM, USE_EXACT_ALARM)</strong>: To schedule reminders precisely at the time you set.</li>
            <li><strong>Vibration (VIBRATE)</strong>: To vibrate your device during a reminder (if enabled).</li>
            <li><strong>Boot Completed (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED)</strong>: To reschedule your reminders after your device restarts.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Service (FOREGROUND_SERVICE*)</strong>: To maintain a reliable reminder service, especially on devices with restrictive background policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Wake Lock (WAKE_LOCK)</strong>: To briefly wake the device to ensure the reminder plays.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Granting these permissions only allows the App to perform these specific actions <em>on your device</em>. We do not use these permissions to access, collect, or transmit any other data from your device.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The current version of the Tact App <strong>does not integrate any third-party SDKs</strong> for analytics, advertising, or cloud services. Therefore, no data is shared with third parties.</p>
        <p><em>If this changes in a future update, this section will be updated with a detailed list and links to their respective privacy policies.</em></p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since your data never leaves your device, its security is inherently tied to the security of your own device (e.g., using a screen lock, keeping your OS updated). We implement standard platform security practices for local data storage.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Data Rights (GDPR & CCPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>Because we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, your rights are simple and powerful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access, Correction & Deletion</strong>: You have full control over all data within the App. You can view, edit, or delete any task at any time. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability</strong>: You can use the in-app “Share” feature to export your task information.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawal of Consent/Objection</strong>: You can revoke system permissions at any time via your device’s settings, which will affect the corresponding functionality (e.g., turning off notifications disables reminders).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any rights regarding your data, you can manage it directly within the App or contact us at the email below.</p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is a general-purpose productivity tool. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. As the App does not collect any information externally, the risk of such collection is nonexistent.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our App’s features. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website and updating the “Last Updated” date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>
        <p><strong>Email: 【yupeng1221@gmail.com】</strong></p>
        <p>We will respond to your inquiry in a reasonable time frame.</p>
